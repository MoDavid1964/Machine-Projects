git commit -m "Created buffer class; function forward declarations."

// While we're at it, let's change the buffering behaviour in case the console was resized
  // _IOFBF means data is written to the output stream once the buffer is full
  // _IOLBF (the default) writes data once a newline is encountered
  // char cBufferArray[dWidth];
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOFBF, consoleScreenBufferInfo.srWindow.Right - consoleScreenBufferInfo.srWindow.Left + 1);

THIS IS INT setSize()

 // This is another thing I found elsewhere which speeds printf up
    // Console output by default is buffered per line, which means everytime we counter a \n things slow down
    // In other words, in only prints in chunks of lines
    // In order to circumvent that hindrance, we set the buffer size ourselves
    
    // _IOFBF means data is written to the output stream once the buffer is full
    // _IOLBF (the default) writes data once a newline is encountered
    // We don't need to do this for Unix anymore cuz it's already quite fast for some reason.
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOFBF, dWidth);
